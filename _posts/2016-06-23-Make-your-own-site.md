Want to make your own Site? well now you can just read this blog and follow the steps that I am going to giving in this post.

The first thing you need to do is make a github account and click on new repoitory. After you do that you can fork my site to help you make your own site. After that make sure you put the branch on gh-pages so that way you can see your post on your site.

Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('Tom')
#=> prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

Check out the [Jekyll docs][jekyll-docs] for more info on how to get the most out of Jekyll. File all bugs/feature requests at [Jekyllâ€™s GitHub repo][jekyll-gh]. If you have questions, you can ask them on [Jekyll Talk][jekyll-talk].
